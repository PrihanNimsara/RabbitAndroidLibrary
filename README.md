# Rabbit



This Rabbit Android library will be helpful when you want to blur the  image you used in activity background.This library has provided the facility to either to increase or reduce the brightness.If you are to do this in the typical way,the complexity of the code that you have to use is very high.But this would help you to do all this  in just one line.
